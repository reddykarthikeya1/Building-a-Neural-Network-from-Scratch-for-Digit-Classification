# Building-a-Neural-Network-from-Scratch-for-Digit-Classification
Hi! I’m Karthikeya Reddy, and today I’ll walk you through how I built a neural network from scratch to classify handwritten digits. No high-level frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch — just Python, NumPy, and math! Along the way, I’ll explain the concepts and code step by step. Let’s dive in!
